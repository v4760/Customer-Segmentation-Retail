# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

## Introduction:
This project assignment revolves around leveraging the eCommerce dataset provided to create a Customer Segmentation model using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis method. RFM segmentation is a valuable technique used by businesses to categorize customers based on their recent purchasing behavior, purchase frequency, and monetary value, facilitating targeted marketing and customer engagement strategies.

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform RFM analysis on the dataset and segment customers into distinct groups based on their RFM scores. These segments will offer actionable insights for devising effective marketing and customer retention strategies.

## Tasks:

### Data Preprocessing:

Import the dataset and conduct necessary data preprocessing steps including cleaning, handling missing values, and data type conversion.

### RFM Calculation:

Calculate the RFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for each customer.

### RFM Segmentation:

Assign RFM scores to each customer based on quartiles or custom-defined bins.
Combine RFM scores to create a single RFM score for each customer.

### Customer Segmentation:

Utilize clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers based on their RFM scores.
Experiment with different cluster numbers to find optimal segments.

### Segment Profiling:

Analyze and profile each customer segment, describing their characteristics and RFM scores.

### Marketing Recommendations:

Provide actionable marketing recommendations tailored to each customer segment to improve retention and maximize revenue.

### Visualization:

Create visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, or heat maps to illustrate RFM distribution and formed clusters.

## Solutions:

### Data Overview:

Size of the dataset in terms of rows and columns, description of each column, and time period covered.

### Customer Analysis:

Number of unique customers, distribution of orders per customer, and top 5 customers with the most purchases.

### Product Analysis:

Top 10 most frequently purchased products, average product price, and highest revenue-generating product category.

### Time Analysis:

Specific day or time of day with the most orders, average order processing time, and seasonal trends.

### Geographical Analysis:

Top 5 countries with the highest number of orders and correlation between customer country and average order value.

### Payment Analysis:

Most common payment methods used by customers and relationship between payment method and order amount.

### Customer Behavior:

Average customer activity duration and identification of customer segments based on purchase behavior.

### Returns and Refunds:

Percentage of orders with returns or refunds and correlation between product category and return likelihood.

### Profitability Analysis:

Total profit generated during the dataset's time period and top 5 products with the highest profit margins.

### Customer Satisfaction:

Analysis of available customer feedback or ratings for products or services and trends in sentiment or feedback.
This project provides a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, offering insights into various aspects of customer behavior, sales trends, and profitability using data visualization techniques and statistical analysis. Detailed documentation and findings are available within the project files.
